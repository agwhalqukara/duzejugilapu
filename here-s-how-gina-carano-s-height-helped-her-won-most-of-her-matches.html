Gina Carano used to compete professionally in MMA, and a good one.</p><p>Having eight fights and winning seven, Gina Carano’s significant and only defeat was her last fight against Cris Cyborg, in which she was knocked out. However, with seven wins in the bag, do you know that Gina Carano’s height played a significant part in helping her secure those wins?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Tall is Gina Carano?</h2><p>Gina Carano stands at 5 feet 8 inches or 173 centimeters, which means she’s slightly above the average of American women. Gina is also an inch taller than the average height for women’s featherweight, increasing her advantage against many competitors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/creeto.com/wp-content/uploads/Gina-Carano-with-Dwayne-Johnson.jpg><p>Her height also contributes to her impressive reach (or some of you might call it wingspan, you do you), which measured 66 inches and a half, or 169 centimeters! Three inches and a half shorter than the average reach, but with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a mighty swing like Gina’s</a>, the lack of reach didn’t matter much.</p><p class=related-post>Read Also: <a href=#>Jason Statham Stays Confident despite Height Difference with Fiance Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a></p><p>Her tall build also helps Gina reach that imposing girl boss character she mainly portrays in various projects.

According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Way of Martial Arts</a>, height and reach are two essential assets in MMA. With a taller height, an athlete usually has longer reach, which makes it easier to strike and block the opponent.</p><p class=related-post>Also Read: <a href=#>Pedro Pascal In His Young Days: From Professional Swimming To Waiting Tables, Discover Why Fans Love Him Even More</a></p><p>That explains Gina’s impressive record in MMA, with seven wins out of eight matches she fought, gaining the title of the Face of Women’s MMA.

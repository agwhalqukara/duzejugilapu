However, they were met with "a flat no."</p><p>Schefter also explained the Chargers "would have had to take on a $63.5 million cap charge for the coming season at a time they have $32.3 million of cap space" with a trade.</p><p>"Justin who?" Chargers general manager Joe Hortiz said on Thursday night, per ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Khris Rihm</a>. "No. No, at the combine I had some people ask me would we consider it, and they were quickly shot down. No, that is never an option."</p><p>That L.A. had no interest in trading Herbert comes as no surprise.</p><p>After all, he is just 26 years old and not <a href=# rel=noopener>scheduled</a> for free agency until 2030. He is the unquestioned franchise quarterback and the cornerstone new head coach Jim Harbaugh will build around upon his return to the NFL.</p><p>Herbert has been in the NFL for four years and already has a resume with an Offensive Rookie of the Year and three seasons with more than 4,300 passing yards, including when he threw for a head-turning 5,014 yards and 38 touchdowns in 2021.</p>NFL <span class=acct>@NFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Every Justin Herbert touchdown in 2022 ⚡️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/SVmDqQxdLC">pic.twitter.com/SVmDqQxdLC&lt;/a></p><p>That New England and Minnesota were the ones reaching out to the Chargers doesn't come as much of a surprise, either.</p><p>The Patriots entered Thursday's draft in need of a quarterback, and Herbert would have been quite the answer to that problem. Instead, they pivoted and selected North Carolina's <a href=#>Drake Maye</a> with the No. 3 overall pick after <a href=#>Caleb Williams</a> and <a href=#>Jayden Daniels</a> went with the first two choices.</p><p>As for Minnesota, Kirk Cousins joined the Atlanta Falcons this offseason.</p><p>There was some <a href=#>speculation</a> that the Vikings would draft a quarterback Thursday, but, like the Patriots, they would have solved any concerns at the position by trading for one of the best signal-callers in the league in Herbert.</p><p>Minnesota and New England surely hoped the Chargers would shift into a physical, run-first approach that Harbaugh showed at Michigan, especially after they parted with wide receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams this offseason. It was worth a call to see if part of that shift would mean moving on from the franchise quarterback.</p><p>Alas, the Chargers reportedly weren't interested at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYW2DcYOMo6ysrJmjeqmx0Zucq6xdqb%2BisMRmqa6ln6fAbrzAramip6Soere1yqKloKtdmK6tuNJmm56mmZqxbq7YZqGipV2drrOuwK6eoWWTna6zs8Srqg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Whether some people gamble or not, a lot of them believe in myths that are basically only lies. And yes, there are tons of lies being spread amongst casino goers that need to be addressed.</span></p><p><span><a href=#>This blog</a> will discuss the 5 biggest gambling myths or lies you should know about, and need not believe them. Let’s start with each one by one.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lie_Number_1_Some_Slot_Machines_are_Hot_and_Some_are_Cold></span><strong>Lie Number 1: Some Slot Machines are Hot and Some are Cold</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>In simple language, a ‘hot slot machine’ is the one that gives you more wins than losses. It means that once a machine begins to pay out, you can expect to win more on that particular machine.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, the cold ones are those that give you more losses. This means that slots can go through a cycle of paying out nothing – and such slot machines are cold slot machines. Here you need to realise that all the slot machines work on the system of RNG (random number generator), and that these machines are checked by third parties as well.</span></p><p><span>This shows that you always have a high chance of winning, on each and every spin. The outcome of the slot machines is not predetermined in any way. So, you can relax and continue to play.</span></p><p><span>It’s all random stuff. Sometimes a machine would continue to pay out, while at other times it would not pay anything for longer cycles.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lie_Number_2_You_Should_Definitely_be_a_Winner_If_You_Havent_Won_for_Long></span><strong>Lie Number 2: You Should Definitely be a Winner If You Haven’t Won for Long</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>A lot of gamblers out there have the wrong view. And it’s that if you haven’t won in a while, and you continue to stick to a game, then it will finally pay you a lot – as your big win is due. People also call it the gambler’s fallacy which should not be believed at any cost.</span></p><p><span>For instance, you are playing on a roulette wheel. And it’s been 15 turns that you are continuously losing. Now that you have lost so much, you should start to believe that on the 16th spin, a big reward is going to occur. This notion is completely false, and many people lose a lot of money doing it.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lie_Number_3_Gambling_on_an_Online_Casino_Platform_is_Illegal></span><strong>Lie Number 3: Gambling on an Online Casino Platform is Illegal</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Another big lie is that people think online casinos are not legal and that they are fake. They think that behind the making of casino platforms, even popular ones like </span><a href=#><b>Betsquare</b></a><span>, there are no laws and regulations being imposed on these platforms.</span></p><p><span>This thinking is absurd and wrong. Most of the online casino platforms have a reputation for following regulations that control them. Also, in different regions and countries, there are proper bodies which have been made for the purpose of overseeing how online casinos are carrying out their operations.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lie_Number_4_Dealers_Secretly_Rig_the_Game></span><strong>Lie Number 4: Dealers Secretly Rig the Game</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The idea of the myth is that if someone is winning a lot, then the dealer will ensure that the person does not win too much via adjustments. Some gamblers feel very weary about how gambling in casinos takes place.</span></p><p><span>Now, it is true that casino games are articulated to give the house the edge. There is no need for a dealer to rig a game. It is because they know that in the overall equation, the casino will be able to make a profit. And this profit is achieved by involving thousands of players.</span></p><p><span>Also, both online casinos and land-based casinos are </span><a href=#><span>checked and regulated</span></a><span> by third-party bodies. These parties are independent in the investigations. Their goal is to safeguard the interest of the players – so there is no rigging in the game.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lie_Number_5_You_Cannot_Win_on_Online_Casinos></span><strong>Lie Number 5: You Cannot Win on Online Casinos</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>It is true that casino games are designed in such a way that the house has an advantage. And that’s how the casinos make their money. Due to this, many people feel that they cannot win in an online casino. This thinking is wrong.</span></p><p><span>Online casinos are also regulated. And a part of this regulation is that they use a random number generator – in order to make sure that fair play takes place. The generators are regularly checked. You can always have peace of mind that a licensed and verified casino will never rig the game and ensure fair play at all times.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpajAqrHCnqOemqNjsLC5jZqsaG1dl7aos8Ssq2akmZrAbq3BqKytZaSdsm6zwKaZpaGenHqqusOuqq2qqWKvsMDHZqafnpyeu6Z5zqejoqaVYrCiv8inpqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

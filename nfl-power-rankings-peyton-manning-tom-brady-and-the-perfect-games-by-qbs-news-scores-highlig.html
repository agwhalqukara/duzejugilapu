Ryan's number was .38 while Morton's was only .22. While that may not seem like to big a difference, it is because touchdowns are so valuable.&nbsp;</p><p>Passer Score is broken down into four different components which are all added together once they're calculated. The components are calculations based on completion percentage, yards per attempt, touchdowns per attempt and interceptions per attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>While they were obviously tied in the last component, Morton came out ahead in the first two by almost 13. However, Ryan won the touchdowns per attempt component by a staggering 64.75.&nbsp;</p><p>For that reason, Frank Ryan wins the prize. He can lay claim to the best statistical performance by a quarterback in the history of professional football.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJobG5raGx%2BbrrFpWSpp6eav26%2BwKeioqaXqHqxsditpqdlnZa7r7XNoGStp51ir7Otw7JkmqaUYsGpsYypnKuelZjBbrPAppysZZKuerKu0g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

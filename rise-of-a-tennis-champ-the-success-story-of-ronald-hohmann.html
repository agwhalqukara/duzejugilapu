Ronald’s rise to fame started out when he won the most prestigious junior tournament in the world, the Eddie Herr International at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. Beating three of the draw’s top five seeds, Ronald became the champ obtaining one of the biggest titles at just 15!</span></p><p><span>But he was just warming up. Two years later, he had a historic win, dominating all nine matches in a nine day tournament. With a winning forehand, he became the first ever qualifier to claim the Gold Ball at the 52</span><span>nd</span><span> annual ITF Adidas Easter Bowl at the Indian Wells, California in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The much needed success and exposure paved the way for Ronald, securing three highly treasured wild cards to major events including the U.S. OPEN Juniors tennis tournament the following September.</span></p><p><span>Graduating from Laurel Springs High school as the best U.S. tennis recruit in 2018, the Louisana State University (LSU) welcomed Ronald as their incoming freshman where he earned a spot at the varsity men’s tennis team, the LSU Tigers. By this time, Ronald was already playing professionally at the US Open Juniors. He also participated in the US Open Boys Double campaign. He’s had the amazing opportunity of training with the best coaches like Todd Widom, Gael Monfils, Fernando Verdasco, Kevin Anderson and a host of many others.</span></p><p><span>As a freshman, his performance on the court involved beating tough opponents with significantly higher professional rankings. </span><i><span>“You don’t necessarily need all the talent in the world, but you just need to have the work ethic and what it takes to win, you have to find ways to win even when you’re not playing your best.” </span></i><span>He stated.</span></p><p><span>Featuring on the men’s singles game for the Tigers, Ronald broke out with some aggressive swings dominating the match against Kaukovalta winning 6-4, 6-4. This victory formed part of a greater celebration as another ‘3’ singles victory for the Tigers was well underway. His teammates Wagner and Koch completed the winning circuit defeating their rivals Harwell, 6-7(2), 6-3, 6-4) and Robb-Wilcox 6-3, 7-6(4) respectively.</span></p><p><span>For Ronald, all the hard work is obviously paying off. He finished his freshman campaign with a 7-5 record in singles and won his first collegiate match against Alcorn State’s Gjorgji Popovski 6-0, 6-1. He also gave #29 South Carolina’s Daniel Rodrigues a beat down in an intense match which ended 6-4, 7-6(9).</span></p><p><span>He’s noted for playing against Florida’s #6 and ITA’s #5 Sam Riffice to a third set, falling 6-4, 2-6, 1-0(8). He also enjoyed playing doubles finishing 9-3 with his partner Rafael Wagner. In the doubles finals of the Olivier Borsos invitational, Ronald Hohmann and Rafael Wagner lashed out for victory against the dynamic duo,&nbsp;Boris Kozlov and Nick Watson finishing 8-5 victory. The extraordinary Tiger’s duo ranked #59 in the ITA’s doubles rankings.</span></p><p><span>Ronald’s unwavering hunger for greatness gets stronger with each game and clearly, as he rises through the ranks, there’s still more to come from this formidable young tennis player. When he’s not playing tennis, off the court he enjoys hanging out with family and friends, giving his school work razor sharp attention, watching football and lots of ice hockey.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kv6q%2FxGamn2WRYsGmus2iqmabmJa6sXnToZxmq6WYsKa%2F0maqraeirnqwsoyrpqeZnJl6qbvHppinpl8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

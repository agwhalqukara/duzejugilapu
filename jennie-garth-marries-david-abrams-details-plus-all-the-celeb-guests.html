The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum’s longtime pal and costar <strong>Tori Spelling</strong> attended along with the friends’ Mystery Girls costar <strong>Miguel Pinzon</strong> and costume designer <strong>Erik Rudy</strong>. Garth, 43, walked down the aisle by herself as a string quartet played. The bride wore a long-sleeved gown, covered in pink flowers and wore her hair in a low side bun.&nbsp;</p><p>Garth’s three daughters with ex-husband<strong> Peter Facinelli</strong> — <strong>Luca</strong>, 17, <strong>Lola</strong>, 12, and <strong>Fiona</strong>, 8 — all wore different dresses with flower crowns. The couple’s guests sat on vintage wooden church pews during the outdoor ceremony. The service took place in Garth’s backyard next to her pool where two white swan floats moved over the surface of the water.&nbsp;</p><p>The altar was made of white wood and covered with a series of flowers including white hydrangeas, greenery, and a sheer pink curtain. There were two ceremony officiants — one male and one female. The newlyweds wrote their own vows and read them aloud to one another in front of their guests.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Jennie switched off between laughing and getting teary eyed as David said his,” an eyewitness tells Us Weekly. “When they kissed and were pronounced husband and wife, everyone screamed and cheered.” &nbsp;</p><p>According to another source, Abrams said vows to all three of Garth’s daughters before exchanging them with his bride. “It was so sweet, one by one,” the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. “He made everyone cry. He had different vows for each of the girls. He said: ‘I’m so honored to take on the role of your stepfather. You guys are like my daughters.’ He said he loves and respects them. It was really sweet.”</p><p>After they were officially married, Garth and producer Abrams walked down the aisle before hugging the three girls.</p><p>“David was so good with all of them,” the source tells Us. “At one point, he picked up Fiona and was holding her while they took pictures. He was very loving and sweet with her.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the ceremony there was a cocktail hour followed by dinner and dancing. The party goers grooved on a wooden dance floor which was surrounded by vintage shabby-chic furniture. A live band performed songs from Marvin Gaye and Barry White. Guests enjoyed Southern food, including grits and chicken, and danced the night away while sipping on moonshine cocktails. The couple shared their first dance to <strong>Elton John</strong>’s “Your Song” and trees were adorned with signs which read “Dancing This Way” and “Bar This Way” guiding guests.</p><p>The party raged on until around midnight.&nbsp;</p><p>This is Garth’s third marriage. She was married to<strong> Daniel Clark </strong>from 1994 to 1996, and she ended her marriage to Facinelli in June 2013. Facinelli, 41, is currently engaged to actress Jaimie Alexander.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGepp6esm6zwKuroWWdlr%2BztcSsZJ2Zpp6xbq3Bq5imq12ZsrWtyKWqZpuVobKjecaunKyso2J%2FcX2Uamlw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

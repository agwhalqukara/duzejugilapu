The celeb mentioned <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> amongst them, making it very clear that she is definitely not only her close friend but also one of the strong businesswomen she really looks up to.</p><p>Fans know about La La Anthony that she can do it all!</p><p>After all, the star is a producer, an investor, an actress and an entrepreneur, just to name a few of her titles.</p><p>She does all of this and she does it well but it turns out that she can’t take the credit all by herself.</p><p>While chatting with HollywoodLife, La La mentioned that her group of powerful women, including Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Bryant and Ciara, have really helped a lot with her own journey in the business world.</p><p>‘You learn and you grow from people around you, so it is great to have an amazing group of friends who are all, doing great things, and you just feed off of each other. We will be like, ‘Hey, have you heard about this yet? You might want to look into it,’ ‘This is something really cool I heard about.’ Those are the sort of friends you want in your circle, who you can grow with and who can introduce you to many new things. And vice versa. It is really important. You can still do all of the fun stuff, too! But it is nice to talk business, and grow together in that space as well.’</p><p>Speaking of business, La La also talked about her being interested in Bitcoin, which she dubbed as the ‘new gold.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘In researching it, I became really into seeing this Bitcoin grow in value so quickly. It is definitely cool to see this happening right in front of your eyes. If you are into investing and taking some chances, it might be something you want to look into. But I would advise everyone to do your research, first.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeclnqtrYyapa2gn6PGbrzRmqCsnaNiuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mmqKZopZ6orrDZqatoJWnerTA0ailoGWWmrqiuMRmnauhlaOxtHnIp2ShnaJitq%2B6xKtknKGimLmmecWoqWahnqi9qr7Ip55moJWneqPB0qKlnqujYsOmutOuqZ6rXWmFdoCPamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

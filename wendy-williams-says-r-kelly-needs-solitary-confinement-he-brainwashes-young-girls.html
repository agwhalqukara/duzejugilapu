Kelly scandal on her show! The host discussed the allegations against the singer during her Hot Topics segment for the second day in a row!</p><p>After previously telling her audience that Kelly needs help and not time behind bars, Wendy argued today that he is a real danger since he seemingly brainwashes young women and should be put in solitary confinement!</p><p>Wendy shared her opinion, that, R. Kelly can no longer be ‘reprogrammed.’</p><p>After playing a clip from the Gayle King interview with Kelly’s much younger girlfriends Azriel Clary, 21, and Joycelyn Savage, 23, she stated: ‘R. Kelly’s hypnotic game, his brainwashing game is so good for young girls’ minds that they&nbsp;actually fell for it. These girls are under his spell.’</p><p>Sure enough, the young women were on Kelly’s side throughout the interview, defending him and slamming their own parents.</p><p>‘I don’t think Robert is re-programmable,’ Williams exclaimed before calling the whole situation ‘horrible.’</p><p>Finally, the talk show host explained how she believes the man should be punished for his crimes.</p><p>‘I think he needs solitary confinement with the leftover food, not the food that first comes out of the kitchen. I think he is beyond counseling, he does not need to see anybody. His food needs to just&nbsp;be sent through a slot. If he wants to exercise then he can stretch in that 5×5&nbsp;he is in. His cot needs to be all cement and needs to clean is own toilet.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Yesterday, Wendy called Kelly a ‘sick man’ who is beyond help after watching the video of his emotional breakdown during his own interview with Gayle King.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHnSmrCsZaJiuKa4y7Jkp52VmcBuv86loK2Zoq56pLvNn6CnnZ2au7V5x55km6qRnru4rdKhnKxlqaTCr7OMoKCrpKNif3aAkW1paA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

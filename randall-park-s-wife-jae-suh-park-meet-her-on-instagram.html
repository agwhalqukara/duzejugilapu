The series premiered on Netflix on November 3rd.</p><p>Since the show's debut on the online platform, viewers have been attracted by both Randall's portrayal of the character and his acting abilities. Similarly, when it was revealed that the star has a beautiful wife who is also a Hollywood actress, many people have been curious to know more about his wife and wondered if their relationship is still working well.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Fumero's weight gain</a></strong>.</p><h2>Randall Park’s Wife: The Blockbuster Cast Has Been Married to Jae Suh Park Since 2009; Find Her on Instagram!</h2><p><strong>Randall Park</strong>&nbsp;is more than just a successful actor and comedian as he’s a father of a baby girl with his beloved wife. <strong>Jae Suh Park</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@thejaesuhpark</a>). Yes, the Blockbuster cast has been married for more than a decade.</p><p>Randall and his wife, Jae Suh, met over a decade ago and appear to be madly in love. While Randall may be better known for his many roles, fans may be surprised to learn that his wife is also a professional working actress who has appeared in guest roles on shows such as NCIS: Los Angeles and How I Met Your Mother but is probably best known as one of the leads in the Netflix series,&nbsp;Friends From College.</p><p>Despite growing up in Lodi, California, Jae has stated that as an Asian American, breaking into Hollywood is difficult. She told Bella Magazine, "When I first moved to LA, it wasn't too difficult to get representation because there were fewer Asian American actors, but there were also fewer opportunities."</p><p>But, luckily, she proved all her critics wrong, landing roles in big-budget <a href=# rel=noopener>films</a> like The Big Short and shows like Adam Ruins Everything. Jae also appeared as Joyce Wong in two episodes of <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong>'s Never Have I Ever, her second collaboration with Mindy; she and Randall had a recurring role as a married couple on The Mindy Project.</p><p>Randall and Jae knew each other long before they met as California natives and Asian-American actors in Los Angeles. They first met at a nonprofit theater fundraiser, where Randall had donated a hand-drawn cartoon of a squirrel without hands.</p><p>Randall Park was too shy to introduce himself at the fundraiser, but the two ran into each other at an audition a few days later. Jae made the first move by asking Randall how much money he helped raise with his squirrel cartoon, and the two spent an hour talking before she was called into the audition and left immediately.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Nonetheless, the universe was adamant. A few days later, the actors reconvened for another audition. Randall invited Jae Suh to his house this time for a casual birthday party he was throwing himself. When Jae arrived, she was surprised to find the party to be Randall and two friends playing Atari.</p><p>Fortunately, she didn't leave right away, and after the party, Randall asked Jae to call him to let him know she arrived safely. Randall wasted no time in asking her out when she did call.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The couple knew they were in love after only two weeks of dating, and Randall proposed a year later at Billingsley's Steak House in West L. A and got married&nbsp;on August 29, 2009.&nbsp;The couple welcomed an adorable <a href=# rel=noopener>baby girl</a> named <strong>Ruby</strong> in 2012, who has appeared in Randall's web series Baby Mentalist and, like her parents, may have a future in acting.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Both actors have found success in their careers since exchanging their vows. Jae has appeared in films including The Big Short, The Paper Tigers, and Marvelous and the Black Hole, as well as television shows including S*x Teenagers, Adam Ruins Everything, and Friends From College.</p><p><strong>Visit <a href=#>Celebs In-depth</a> for more <a href=#>interesting stories</a> about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGipmqaUlrmtec%2BaqaRlp56zpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

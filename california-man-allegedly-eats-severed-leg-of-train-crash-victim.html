Their leg was also severed in the incident, and witnesses allegedly saw 27-year-old Resendo Tellez remove the body part from the scene.</p><p>Then, a crew laying concrete nearby reported something even more disturbing: Tellez began eating the leg.</p><h2>The Disturbing Video Of The Incident</h2><p>“I’m not sure from where, but he walked this way and he was waving a person’s leg. And he started chewing on it over there, he was biting it and he was hitting it against the wall and everything,” said Jose Ibarra, a worker who saw the grisly incident.</p><p>One witness even captured video of a man reported to be Tellez carrying the leg and swinging it about.</p><p>“On the video that we have, it shows clearly that he started chewing on the leg and everything,” Ibarra said.</p><p>The video was acquired by <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC 23 Bakersfield</a>, among other outlets.</p><p>“On the leg, the skin was hanging. You could see the bone,” continued Ibarra.</p><p>Employees of the Amtrak station quickly called police to inform them of the ghastly crime, and investigators arrived on the scene shortly after to arrest Tellez.</p><p>Tellez was taken into custody without incident, and he’s been charged with moving a body part from a place that is not a cemetery, disposing of human remains in a place that is not a cemetery, destroying or concealing evidence, and resisting law enforcement.</p><h2>Resendo Tellez, The Alleged Perpetrator</h2><p>Days after the incident, <a href=# rel=noopener>KGET</a> published a report revealing more information about Tellez, though there is much that remains unknown about the man.</p><p>Residents of Wasco reported that Tellez was homeless and often slept in a doorway near Wasco Liquor. One employee of the store said Tellez was a regular customer who entered the shop multiple times daily to purchase food or beer.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-481848 alt="Resendo Tellez At The Liquor Store" width=900 height=602 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/resendo-tellez-at-the-liquor-store.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-481848 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Security Footage/KGET</span><span class=caption-body>Resendo Tellez seen on security camera footage making a purchase at the liquor store shortly before the incident.</span></p><p>In fact, security camera footage from the business shows Tellez entering and making a purchase just hours before the incident occurred.</p><p>The employee said she never would have expected Tellez to do something so heinous.</p><p>“No, it can’t be him,” she thought when she first heard the news.</p><p>Tellez reportedly took the severed limb because “he thought the leg was his.” According to court records, he has several other misdemeanor convictions, mostly related to drugs and alcohol — but he’s never faced charges like this.</p><p>The Kern County Sheriff’s Office stated that they cannot provide any more information about the case at this time.</p><p>After reading about this grisly incident in California, go inside <a href=#>17 cannibal attacks</a> that will make your stomach churn.

While fans saw Jordan with Harrison, Claire’s whereabouts are still unknown.</p><p>What if Jordan dumped Claire somewhere, and she returns disheveled and confused? Claire will try to explain that she woke up in the middle of nowhere, but a lot of people won’t believe her. With Harrison still missing, Claire’s troubles could multiply.</p><h2>Harrison Abbott’s Kidnapping</h2><p>Y&R spoilers reveal that Claire went to see Kyle Abbott (Michael Mealor) after Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and Nikki Newman’s (Melody Thomas Scott) celebration. Claire returned Harrison’s lucky charm, which he left at the party.</p><p>Kyle invited Claire in and allowed her to read Harrison a bedtime story. The next thing Kyle knew, Claire and Harrison were both gone.</p><p>Of course, fans know that Jordan used chloroform on Claire, and took Harrison. We’re not sure where Claire is right now. Is she still passed out and locked up somewhere?</p><p>Is she in the same hotel room as Jordan and Harrison? Did Jordan dump Claire somewhere isolated?</p><h3>Y&R Spoilers: Jordan’s Brainwashing Attempt</h3><p>In the episode that aired on Tuesday, April 16, 2024, Jordan and Harrison were seen in what appeared to be a motel or hotel room. Harrison was sitting on a chair in the corner holding his knees close to the chest.</p><p>Jordan told Harrison that she was his Aunt Jordan and would be taking care of him from now on. When Harrison demanded Kyle and Summer Newman (Allison Lanier), Jordan told the little boy that his parents didn’t want him anymore.</p><p><img alt="The Young and The Restless: Jordan (Colleen Zenk)" width=730 height=411 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/04/the-young-and-the-restless-spoilers-claires-mysterious-return-harrison-still-missing/ data-jpibfi-post-title="The Young and the Restless Spoilers: Claire’s Mysterious Return, Harrison Still Missing?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Yr-Jordan-12.38.40 AM.jpeg></p><h3>Claire Grace’s Mysterious Return</h3><p><a href=#>The Young and the Restless spoilers reveal that everyone in Genoa City</a> is divided on the Harrison/Claire situation. Summer is convinced that Claire stole Harrison, and won’t listen to any evidence that suggests otherwise.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cole Howard (J. Eddie Peck) and Victor both refuse to entertain the notion that Claire might have duped them all. Most characters fall somewhere in the middle as they need more information.</p><p>What if Claire suddenly waltzes into Genoa City? Everyone will be asking her questions, but what if she doesn’t have any answers? Perhaps Jordan dumped Claire somewhere remote when she was still passed out.</p><p><a href=#>When Claire woke up alone and in the middle of nowhere,</a> she had no idea what happened. Perhaps Claire even hitched a ride back to Genoa City. In any case, everyone will want to know why Claire isn’t with Harrison.</p><h3>The Young and the Restless Spoilers: Innocence & Disbelief</h3><p>It’s possible that Claire will try to explain herself even if she doesn’t remember anything. Most people in Genoa City will blame Claire. After all, the evidence does make Claire look guilty.</p><p>Cole was certainly right about that. More importantly, Harrison needs to be found before Jordan gets away with brainwashing another innocent child.</p><p>Share your thoughts in the comment section below.

However, it was a recent post where she professed her love for the actor right after it was revealed he was expecting another baby that social media users were made aware.</p><p><a href=#>Jessica</a> was seemingly okay with the fact that her man was having baby number two with another woman and warded off the hate comments from confused followers. She even opened up about her infertility issues.</p><p>She wrote to a fan: ‘Nick and I have been together off and on for years . Their new child was conceived when we had temporarily broken up. Any child is a blessing. This is the last time I will answer these questions. I am no home wrecker at all. Nick was a free man at that time and can be with whoever he so chooses and for years that person has always been me. That is between him and Britney I support him through thick and thin as he does the same for me. Have a blessed day. I hope this clears up people’s misconceptions as I am being honest about this delicate and complicated situation. With that I hope to stop having to answer this nonsense and focus on the important things in life . Long life health healing spirituality and the current climate in the world as it pertains to us all . The whole world is suffering at this time I would hope to see more positivity than negativity god bless you all.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CChc7uOBOFA/?</a></p><p>Now, Jessica is changing her tune. She recently took to her page to announce that they have split. She even joked to see if Brad Pitt was available.</p><p>‘<span>Someone who values you, wouldn’t ever put themselves in a position to lose you. I’m so blessed, I’m whole, and ready to embrace a single life free from all baggage, I wish nothing but the best for&nbsp;@nickcannon But truly excited for the next chapter in my life. Someone tag Brad Pitt and let him know I’m single and momma has an abundance of pure love to give! Hahahahaha.’</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think happened between the two?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeamsC0tcKaZLCgmamybq3NnWSnoZOgeqStzaemp2WjpbmqwIywmKeso2LBsHnDmqueZZKnrqV5z6KrrWWemsW1eZNrbmpuYWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

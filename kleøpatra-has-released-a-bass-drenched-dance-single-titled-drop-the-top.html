Bringing a new take to dubstep switching it around dark EDM and moody synths, it’s impossible not to fall for this track. This follows up Kleøpatra’s June 2022 release “Blast Like” as well as her May 2022 collaboration with JAYSYX and G The Shep titled “Defiance”.</p><p>Kleøpatra, real name Alexis Nicole Perry, is a rising Utah-based DJ and producer who is already making waves in the electronic world for her aggressive and volatile bass-drenched tracks. She’s bringing her knowledge as a classically trained multi-instrumentalist to the table, crashing into clubs and serving us all with sonically-charged dance that will get us all moving before we even know it. As she continues to propel into this industry, she’s bound to grab the attention of some big names, and she already has with the likes of Dirty Snatcha, Zeds Dead, Riot Ten, and many more. She has toured all across the US and even performed at Phoenix Lights 2022, Lost Lands 2021 & 2022, and Deadbeats House Party in 2021. Her collaboration with G The Shep, “Favorite Fallacy”, is currently her most-streamed track on Spotify with over 100,000 streams, to date. She’s certainly someone we’ll be keeping our eyes and ears on.</p><p>Written by Alexis Nicole Perry, “Drop The Top” hits hard from the very start as Kleøpatra soaks the listeners with bass. The electric rhythm with the added synths and glitch-like elements guarantees dance movements from everyone who listens to the song. Throughout the track, vocals are added to build anticipation and tension, but rather than taking the spotlight, they’re warped into the track. Kleøpatra has created a sound like no other, a beat that actually has a life of its own, and one that demands everyone to groove to. “Drop The Top” is a total production masterpiece and certainly showcases Kleøpatra’s incredible musicality and technique, all the while turning listeners into fans who are left eagerly awaiting more new music from this incredible DJ.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stream “Drop The Top” by Kleøpatra on Spotify here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“Drop The Top”, by Kleøpatra, is available to download and stream across all platforms, right now, via IRIDIUM.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Let us know what you make of “Drop The Top” by Kleøpatra on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>.</h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kuK2xzqmYraqRYrWiv4yrnKWdkaiypXnAZpmaq6NisbOxzZyfnpxdma6vr8RmqqKml6GybsDIraOenF2Zv7C8jK2fnmWkpL1w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

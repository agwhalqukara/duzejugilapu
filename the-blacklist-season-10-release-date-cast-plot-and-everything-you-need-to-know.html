The show premiered on NBC for the first time in September 2013. The series has been written by Jon Bokenkamp and directed by Joe Carnahan. The show has aired nine seasons so far. All the seasons have received positive reviews, which explains why a new season has been renewed yearly. Besides garnering great excellent reviews and ratings from viewers and fans, critics have also been impressed by Spader’s performance. Last year, The Blacklist completed airing season 9 on 27th May 2022, and the tenth season is already in the cooking.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>The Blacklist Season 10 Storyline:</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-blacklist-season-8-storyline.jpg><p><span>The series explores the life of a former US Navy officer named Spader. The officer apparently left the <a href=#>military</a></span> and entered <span>the <a href=#>criminal</a> world. It’s 20 years since he got into crime and became a popular and wanted criminal across the US. In an unexpected turn of events, Spader would surrender himself to the <a href=#>FBI</a>. He promises the investigators to help them track down all the terrorists he has spent with the last 20 years. Some of these terrorists are apparently very devious, and the US government is unaware of them. All this effort would be in exchange for his immunity against prosecution and only working exclusively with Elizabeth Keen. The collaborations work well until Spader develops an interest in keenness as the series progresses.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>The Blacklist Season 10 Release Date:</span></h2><p>Season nine premiered in the United States in October 2021.</p><p>As of right now, The Blacklist’s tenth season has no set premiere date. However, if we had to guess when the series would be released, we could say it would happen in 2023. But since these are only rumors, we must wait for the official announcement before learning when the series will premiere.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>The Blacklist Season 10 Cast:</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-blacklist-season-8-cast.jpg><p><span>Your favorite cast from all the previous seasons will be making a comeback to the show. From James Spader playing Raymond Reddington, Megan Boone playing Elizabeth Keen, Diego Klattenhoff playing Donald Ressler and Eggold playing Tom Keen. It is not confirmed whether the new cast will be added to the show, but that should be expected.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Blacklist Season 10 Trailer:</h2><p>The Blacklist Season 10 has no official promo&nbsp;or trailers. Additionally, we have no information from official sources regarding the season’s production schedule. As a result, we will have to wait patiently to see our favorite thriller. Although the wait will be lengthy, maybe it will be worthwhile! Here you can watch the trailer of Season 9:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span>The Blacklist Season 10 Expected Plot:</span></h2><p>The chemistry between Red and Liz was a big part of The Blacklist’s plot, but now that it’s gone, the show will need to find a new emphasis, which is likely to be Red’s drive for revenge after his daughter was murdered.

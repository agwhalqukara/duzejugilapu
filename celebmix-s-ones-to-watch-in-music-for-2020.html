From record-breakers to reunions to artists reaching stratospheric new heights, we’ve really seen it all this year.</p><p>There’s no doubt that 2019 has been the year of the woman, with the likes of <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a> and <a href=#>Lizzo</a> rising through the ranks and achieving astronomical success. Established artists including <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=#>Camila Cabello</a> and <a href=#>Halsey</a> have continued to dominate with their latest releases, whilst <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> made her long awaited musical comeback, which saw her land her first ever number one on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>The men have also stepped up during 2019 with the likes of Post Malone, <a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a> and <a href=#>BTS</a> dominating on streaming services, whilst <a href=#>Stormzy</a> achieved his first solo UK number one single with ‘Vossi Bop’ and delivered an iconic performance as he headlined the <a href=#>Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury</a>.</p><p>2019 has also been a stellar year for reunions. Back in February, our teen hearts were fixed again when the <a href=#>Jonas Brothers</a> announced their comeback, which was followed by their first ever Billboard Hot 100 number one, ‘Sucker’. The trio later released their album <a href=#>Happiness Begins,</a> embarked on a mammoth tour, released a documentary, and much more.</p><p>British band <a href=#>McFly</a> also made their long-awaited comeback with a one-off gig at London’s O2 Arena. They will be <a href=#>embarking on a huge tour</a> next year and have also released The Lost Songs which should have formed part of their sixth album, much to the delight of their fans. Most recently, the <a href=#>Pussycat Dolls</a>, albeit now a five piece, also announced their return with a jaw dropping performance on The X Factor: Celebrity. They too will be <a href=#>touring the UK</a> early next year.</p><p>Finally, 2019 has also seen a number of newer artists rise through the ranks. Who can forget the moment they first heard ‘Old Town Road’ by <a href=#>Lil Nas X</a>? The track, which also featured Billy Ray Cyrus and was later remixed to include the likes of Diplo, <a href=#>RM</a>, and Mason Ramsey, spent a gargantuan 19 weeks at the top of Billboard’s Hot 100, breaking the previous record of 16 weeks as held by both Mariah Carey and Boys II Men’s ‘One Sweet Day’ and Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber’s ‘Despacito’.</p><p>Over in the UK, Australian singer Tones and I took over the chart with her single ‘Dance Monkey’. The track spent 11 weeks at number one and has broken the record for the longest-running Number 1 single by a female artist in UK chart history, surpassing Rihanna’s ‘Umbrella’ and Whitney Houston’s ‘I Will Always Love You’.</p><p>We also cannot forget <a href=#>Lewis Capaldi</a>, who has enjoyed the most sensational year. From spending numerous weeks at the top of the UK singles and album chart, selling out tours worldwide, getting his first Billboard Hot 100 number one, and earning his first Grammy nomination, he has proven to be one of the UK”s biggest breakthrough stars, <a href=#>as we predicted last year</a>.</p><p>In fact, during 2019 we’ve enjoyed watching a number of newer artists emerge and making moves in the industry. Here at CelebMix, we love championing fresh talent so we’ve rounded up 30 of our favourite up and coming artists who we believe will be ones to watch in 2020.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Aitch</h4><p>Harrison Armstrong, better known as MC Aitch, made a massive breakthrough this year particularly with his single ‘Taste (Make It Shake)’ which peaked at number two on the Official UK Singles Chart. The rapper released his AitcH2O EP earlier this year which also garnered commercial success and was supported by a UK tour. The only way is up for this Manchester MC and we can’t wait to see what he does next year.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Alaina Castillo</h4><p>Rising star Alaina Castillo might only be 18 years old, but this Texas songstress has made a huge impact with her music this year. Her first single ‘i don’t think i love you anymore’ has garnered almost three million views on YouTube whilst her debut EP <a href=#>antisocial butterfly</a> has already amassed over five million combined streams. Having recently picked up support from Radio 1, we can expect to hear much more from Alaina come 2020.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Alec Benjamin</h4><p>Alec Benjamin has been on the scene for quite some time however, he really came into his own in 2019 following a re-released version of his song ‘Let Me Down Slowly’ featuring Alessia Cara. He’s also released a string of singles including the brilliant <a href=#>‘Jesus In LA’</a> and embarked on a huge world tour including shows in Tokyo, Stockholm, Berlin, Warsaw, Paris and London.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Alfreda</h4><p>Emerging alt-pop star Alfreda has delighted us with two great tracks this year, ‘This Room’ and ‘Anyone’. She has emerged as a confident artist whose confessional songwriting style has caught the attention of Clash, Official Charts and Spindle Magazine. With more new music on the horizon in 2020, it’s safe to say that this is just the beginning for Alfreda.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Anitta</h4><p>Anitta is already a well established artist in her native Brazil, and has racked up over 3.8 billion views. This year she released her fourth album Kisses through Warner Music Brazil and released collaborations with the likes of Becky G, DJ Snake, Sean Paul, Black Eyed Peas and more. 2020 will see Anitta release her first completely English-speaking solo album and we can only expect to see her continue to thrive to gargantuan new levels of success.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Beabadoobee</h4><p>Filipino-British songstress Beabadoobee has had a fantastic 2019, releasing three EPs under the Dirty Hit label.

Following the success of her Naïve EP and receiving plaudits from Clash, BBC Introducing London and gal-dem to name but a few, Cat showcased a new side to her artistry with her single ‘I Don’t Blame You’.

Her intoxicating girls anthem features NLE Choppa and we can expect even more urban pop tracks from Holly which have been inspired by a broken heart. With new music on the horizon throughout 2020, this is only the beginning for Holly Baby.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Isaiah Dreads</h4><p>Hip-hop and rap artist Isaiah Dreads has continued to rise throughout 2019 particularly following the release of his EP <a href=#>No Ego</a>.

With more tracks and music videos on the horizon, 2020 is looking bright for Isaiah Dreads.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>ITZY</h4><p>A number of K-Pop artists have risen through the ranks this year but one that we’re particularly championing are girl group ITZY.

Over the past few months, ITZY have won numerous awards including a MAMA Award for Best New Female Artist and will be heading out on an American showcase tour in January.

Earlier this year he sold out a four show residency at The Islington London and in May next year he’ll be playing his biggest Irish headline show to date at The Academy Dublin.

Cian, Joel and Sonny might be familiar to some as they were previously in another boyband called Yes Lad, who competed on The X Factor UK. However, as a trio they have grown from strength to strength particularly with the support of their mentor will.i.am. NXTGEN have released a string of singles throughout the year, and with a growing back catalogue behind them, we predict that 2020 will be a huge breakthrough year for the band.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Real Like You</h4><p>Real Like You were put together on the latest X Factor series, X Factor: The Band with the girlband triumphing over their boyband competitors during the live final.

Not only has she released her own beautiful tracks, but Sasha is making a name for herself in the industry as a songwriter to the stars. Her credits include songs for Camila Cabello, Anne-Marie, LANY, Charli XCX, Idina Menzel and more. There’s no doubt that 2020 will continue to see Sasha flourish as an artist in her own right as well as a sought after songwriter.</p><p></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Siva</h4><p>Former The Wanted singer Siva Kaneswaran made his highly-anticipated solo debut in 2019 with the dreamy <a href=#>‘Breathe In’</a>.

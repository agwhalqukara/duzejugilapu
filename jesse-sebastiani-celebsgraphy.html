So fans began wondering where one of the members and one of the crucial members of the group disappeared.</p><p>Finally, after many speculations, Kyle Forgeard came forward and <a href=# rel=noopener>revealed the reason</a> for his disappearance in his Twitch stream. According to Kyle, Jesse did like appearing in videos, but it seems as if he was also taking a break from making prank videos. He said, “I just think Jesse’s kinda done with the videos and s**t, like in a way.”</p><p>Being a prankster has had its effect on the group. Some of their videos raise a loss of suspicion because they have had <strong>cops</strong> involved in their videos. He and his friend Kyle has also spent a night in jail, and they have also visited the court many times.</p><p>One such prank was when Jesse walked into a book store with <strong>fake blood</strong> all over him.

"I didn't know about nutrition, or really, I always just had a super-fast metabolism. But also, because my body was maturing and growing up, I had to learn how to eat a more balanced diet. And I really learned and got excited about baking and cooking with healthy ingredients, fresh ingredients, a more balanced diet of vegetables and protein, and learning what it means to actually eat clean. In doing so, I not only feel better in my body and more confident in my body, but I also have so much more energy. That has been a whole other education."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/GettyImages-1406673925.jpg><p><span>Kloss tells Byrdie that her job has made her a stronger person. ​​"This job is one that requires a lot of hard work, a lot of </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>travel</span></a><span>, a lot of time by yourself on an airplane [or] in a hotel," she says.

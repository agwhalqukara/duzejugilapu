The company has over 100 years of combined cinema operation and development experience gained in England, Italy, the USA, and Spain. When Filmhouse gained entrance into the Nigerian market in 2012 through two young Nigerians, they were determined to become the leading cinema brand in the country. To achieve this, they gave nothing short of the excellence the company has been known for for decades across the world.</p><p>The company kicked off operations with Filmhouse Surulere. They had a game plan of rolling out twenty-five (25) cinemas over a six (6) year period. Almost nine years down the line, they have been able to roll out a total of 15 (fifteen) cinemas in nine states across Nigeria. Even though they may seem to be running behind their plan, their vision is still intact with a roll-out plan factoring all cities in Nigeria and beyond. Driven by a strong experienced management team, innovative marketing activities, and impressive guest service standards, they sure would reach their target and surpass in no time.</p><h3><strong>A Brief History Of Filmhouse Cinema Nigeria</strong></h3><p>Filmhouse Cinemas Nigeria was founded by two Nigerians; Kene Okwuosa and Moses Babatope. According to Okwuosa, they had identified an under-reached market in Nigeria and an opportunity in people’s craving for entertainment, and so, they sought to meet these demands with a quality offering, and that was what gave birth to Filmhouse Cinemas.</p><p>The duo took a loan from the Bank of Industry, a Nigerian development finance institution and in December 2012, they launched the first outlet of the cinemas in the Surulere area of Lagos State, South-West Nigeria. By 2018, Filmhous became the largest cinema chain in Nigeria and the third-largest in Africa.</p><h2><strong>Filmhouse Cinemas Locations and Contact Addresses Across Nigeria</strong></h2><p>Filmhouse now has fifteen cinemas in nine states across the country.

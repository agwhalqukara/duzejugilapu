We surprised 10 moms with everything on their children’s wishlist, complete with brunch, Santa, gift wrapping and more. Special thanks to @djtarxan @chef_petey @thegatheringspots @jasminecrowe and all of our amazing volunteers! Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! #BeautifulBosses #GiveBack.”</p><p>Toya also penned a sweet message about the ladies at the special event: “My girls and I came together to make sure these beautiful mothers have an amazing Christmas. We picked a few families and bought everything on their children’s Christmas lists. They had no idea that we were doing this. They thought they were meeting with someone to see about something else entirely. I enjoyed every moment with these ladies…it’s such a blessing when you are able to bless others. I know what’s it’s like to not have so I love giving when I’m able. #BBC #giveback #christmas2018.”</p><p>One fan told the ladies that they were inspirational and praised them for their good deeds: “That’s a beautiful thing!

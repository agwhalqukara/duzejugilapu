He has received <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">questions</a> in a few of his online live streams, that he perceived to be inappropriate concerning Zaya. In one of the questions, he was asked if the eighteen-year-old would consider dating Zaya. A presumed answer to that question was a video update on TikTok where he revealed the type of girls he would consider dating. After he uploaded the video, he received a lot of criticism, which he did not respond to.</p><h3>Zion Wade surgery</h3><p class=align-left>Zaya is yet to undergo any surgical procedures as she is still not old enough. Her parents have not released any information regarding any medication that she may be taking. Therefore, it is presumed that she has not undergone any medical procedures. Her parents have been supportive of her decision, and Dwayne opened up about the issue while on the Ellen DeGeneres show. While there, he said,</p>First of all, me and my wife Gabrielle, we are proud parents of a child in the LGBTQ+ community, and we are proud allies as well. Once Zaya, our 12-year-old, came homeâ€¦ first, Zion. I don't know if everyone knows; originally named Zion. Zion, born as a boy, came home and said, "Hey, so I want to talk to you guys...I think going forward, I'm ready to live my truth. And I want to be referenced as she and her. I'd love for you guys to call me Zaya."<h3>Zion Wade pictures</h3><p class=align-left>1.

A third-round draft pick of the Patriots in 2013, he spent four years there and was a two-time Super Bowl champion.</p><p>Across his career, Ryan had 755 tackles, 19 interceptions, 98 pass breakups and 15 forced fumbles in 154 games.</p><p>He might be the answer to a trivia question one day because he has the distinction of intercepting Tom Brady's last pass as a member of the Patriots. His pick-six sealed a 20-13 win for the Tennessee Titans in the AFC Wild Card Round during the 2019 season.</p>NFL <span class=acct>@NFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>PICK-6!&lt;br>&lt;br>The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Titans?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Titans&lt;/a> extend their lead with nine seconds left. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Titans?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Titans&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLPlayoffs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NFLPlayoffs&lt;/a>&lt;br>&lt;br>ðŸ“º: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TENvsNE?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TENvsNE&lt;/a> on CBS&lt;br>ðŸ“±: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app&lt;br>Watch free on mobile: &lt;a href="https://t.co/EF5fHZbZSf">https://t.co/EF5fHZbZSf&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/AOcwqlTSlc">pic.twitter.com/AOcwqlTSlc&lt;/a></p><p>That Ryan tasted the playoffs in eight different years was no coincidence. While he wasn't considered an elite cornerback/safety, franchises considered him an ingredient to a winning formula.</p><p>His last stop was a testament to his reputation. He was on a cruise with his family when the Niners reached out about their interest in signing him midway through the 2023 campaign.</p><p>"Once I knew the 49ers were interested, at that point, there wasn't any drinking on the cruise, and I occupied that gym quite a bit," he <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> after signing with the team. "It was cool. It was my first Thanksgiving on a boat."</p><p>Ryan made five regular-season appearances with the 49ers and was on the field for <a href=# rel=noopener>78 percent</a> of their defensive snaps in Super Bowl LVIII. Head coach Kyle Shanahan <a href=# rel=noopener>praised his ability</a> to seamlessly move into a starting safety role on the fly.</p><p>Football fans may not have seen the last of Ryan even though his playing career is over. In Tuesday's announcement, he teased that there's "a lot in store."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWt%2Bc3yMpaagmZ5iv7qtzWaYp6afqruksdJmpZ%2BkXaeytbXRnqSepqRixLC6jGtkrK2gmr9urs6wo6xlp57BqXnPmquroZ%2BpwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Speaker Nancy Pelosi never saw eye-to-eye and their latest war of words all but confirms that while they are members of the same party, they have no plans to make peace in the near future.</p><p>On Wednesday, the firebrand from New York ruffled many feathers by lashing out at the speaker by implying she only sees the Caucasian members of the House of Representative.</p><p>According to the fresh-faced politician, Pelosi has apparently been disrespectful towards her and other women of color including Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), and Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Talking to The Washington Post, AOC said the veteran congresswoman’s criticisms towards the congresswomen of color are “outright disrespectful.”</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez added: “When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm’s distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood.”</p><p>She went on to say: “But the persistent singling out … it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful … the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.”</p><p>The tension between the two women started rising after Pelosi requested that members of her caucus stop tearing each other when they disagree on policies.</p><p>The California Democrat shared: “You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it. But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK.”</p><p>Pelosi recently made this remark that irked AOC: “All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people, and that’s how many votes they got.”</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez responded by saying: “That public ‘whatever’ is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country. The third and fourth time [she insulted me], it was like, ‘This is unnecessary, but I’m not going to pick a fight over it. Whatever, I’ll be the punching bag if that’s what they want me to be.’”</p><p>A source told the publication the ladies have not spoken for the past six months and added: “Now, half a year later, virtually all communication between the two women has ceased. The two had not spoken one-on-one since February when Ocasio-Cortez declined Pelosi’s personal request that she join her select committee on climate change, according to individuals who know both lawmakers.”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez is said to be furious that Pelosi is not eager to impeach President Donald Trump.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRobK5rc2dqaKZXaSwor%2FIqGScp6Kpsrt5wJyarquVqHqvrc2csGaolaG8tLWMqJ1mnJmov6a%2Fz56araGenHqpsdFmpZ6vXa68s7eMn6CrnZKnrq%2BwjKKqZquRnrFuwM5mmZ5llqq%2FqrvUrGSorpWneq2twqRkqJ5dlrC1tc6nZK2nXamurLGMnaawpl2ZvK%2Bty51krayiqrqxeZJpaGxpZGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

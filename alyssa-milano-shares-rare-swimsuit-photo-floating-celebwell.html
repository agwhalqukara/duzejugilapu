Milano, 50, shared pictures of herself looking stunning in a dark green swimsuit and straw hat, enjoying the water on a bright pink pool float. "Floating into the weekend like…" she captioned the post. "So crazy how you keep getting prettier!" a fan commented. How does she stay so fit?</span> <span>Read on to see 5 ways </span><span>Milano</span><span> stays in shape and the photos that prove they work.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/shutterstock_1159284967.jpg><p><span>Milano once started the day with coffee and protein bars. "The kids wake me up and then I can't even think about it," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I have to just dive into getting them ready for school, which is different with two than it was with one. I eat the Atkins lifestyle, so I [cut back on] carbs. In the morning, I'll do a cup of coffee and then on the way to the gym, I'll do an Atkins shake or one of their protein bars, or something else that's fast, so I'm not going to eat the pancakes I make for the kids. It's all a balancing act."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_586594067.jpg><p><span>Milano enjoys getting the most bang for her buck timewise when it comes to workouts. "I love spinning [at Peloton]," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I also love Pilates and yoga. Occasionally I'll take a dance class or a Zumba class. But I really like to spin because I feel like it's a full-body workout: 45 minutes, you're in and you're out. I don't really have time for much more than that. I used to do a lot of yoga, but I just don't have time for a 90-minute class anymore… I always say, 'Eat less, move more.' It's about eating less carbs and moving more; that could mean anything that you enjoy doing that is actually active. It doesn't have to be working out; it could be gardening or hiking or taking the kids out for a walk in the stroller."</span></p><p><span>Milano makes an effort to take time for herself every day. "That is a learning process that I am continuing to try and figure out," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "There are no tips that I can give because every day is something different, you know? It's a very hard balance for sure. But I do find that the most important thing in being a working mother is to just try, no matter how hard it is to find time for yourself and to do the things that make you happy. And do whatever it takes to help yourself relax."</span></p><p><span>Milano tries to focus on healthy sleep habits for her health. "Every sleep expert that I spoke to about trying to get my baby to sleep through the night said how important a bedtime routine is for the baby," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "And it just may be that as adults, we have not made time for ourselves in that same way anymore. So I really started to try to pay more attention to my own sleep habits and I just really think that the product really puts you in a place of comfort and allows you to sleep better. I don't really feel guilty about this, but I do need to have some dark chocolate every night before I go to sleep."</span></p><p><span>Milano grows her own vegetables in the family garden. "We have an organic vegetable garden in the backyard," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "So my kids from a very young age would be in the garden with me and pick tomatoes or peppers off the vine and eat it there. And I think that's so important. Kids love to see vegetables grow, and get to see that that's where their food is from. To this day, both my kids, if there's French fries on the plate and broccoli, they will go for the broccoli."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKK42KyqmmWdnrmius5mqqGZoprAbr7Aq5xmq6eeurTByK1kqaCfqbxussuomK2hnpx8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

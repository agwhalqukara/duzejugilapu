Users woke up to find they could not retrieve tweets on their timelines, and the glitch went viral. Netizens tried to figure out what was happening on the social media platform.</p><h2>X went down</h2><p class=align-left>Netizens woke up on the morning of 21 December and found that X, formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>, was not correctly working. Instagram user <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@theshaderoom</a> posted a few pictures of the glitch, showing no tweets flowing. On the trending bar, "My Twitter", "Did Twitter", and "Welcome to X" trended with almost 2 million cumulative tweets, which strangely could not be seen. After a few moments, the platform started working again, but this was not without many jokes from internet users.

At the Critics Choice Awards on Monday, June 10, the funnyman and his wife of three years, model/actress <strong>Clare Grant</strong>, told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> that they're in no rush to start a family just yet.</p><p>"A lot of pressure, no plans," Green told <strong>Us</strong> of parenthood. "People have just gotten used to certain cultural cycles and they can't wait for the end of them."</p><p>Added Grant: "The day we got married, people started asking when the kids were coming."</p><p>Green, 39, and Grant, 33, said "I do" in May 2010 during a Northern California ceremony after meeting in a comic book store. "And now I won't let her go!" Green told Us at the time of falling for his now-wife.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The duo appeared onscreen together in a 2008 episode of Green's show Robot Chicken, which is set to debut a new season this fall. Grant is currently working on a pilot for a live animation/action hybrid comedy called Teen Unicorn for Adult Swim.</p><p>Though they're both busy, however, Green admitted that at the end of the day, the pair are still in their "honeymoon phase."</p><p>"We still like each other," he said, adding that he and Grant occasionally read scripts together "sometimes to practice. She's good for it. It's fun!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqerJhitLOxxKdkqKZdl7Kku8yipaBlkWKzosDHnqlmmV2hvLV5zp9kqaqVqMC2vsRmpahloKGur7%2BMa2dqa2Fogw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

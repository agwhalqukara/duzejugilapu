Embracing gray hair seems to be more and more popular these days, whether it's a bit salt and peppery or full on silver. There are even a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>lot of benefits</a> to going gray, but it's important to keep the strands healthy. Like all colors, gray needs some TLC, so there's no yellowing or brassiness.</p><p>Your gray or silver locks could be turning yellow for several reasons.<strong> Akirashanti Byrd</strong>, the founder and CEO of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Curl Centric</a> shares that "yellowing &nbsp;is typically due to a buildup of pigment in the hair shaft." She explains that exposure to environmental pollutants, UV radiation, yellow-tone shampoos, certain chemicals, or even medications are all cause for an unwanted change in color. The good news is that there are various ways to avoid the yellow.

They are made to get rid of all the extra build-up or residue left on your scalp from other styling products or environmental factors. <strong>Amie Justine</strong>, the owner and lead stylist at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Emma Justine Color & Extension Lounge</a> recommends using clarifying products just once a week.

She explains that using the purple conditioner after the shampoo is key or else the strands could become dehydrated.&nbsp; The sulfate-free options will also help reduce chemical buildup and are generally better for minimizing scalp irritation.</p><p><strong>For more beauty advice delivered straight to your inbox,<span>&nbsp;</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/shutterstock_1712295082.jpg><p>Similar to how the purple reverses yellowing, silver highlights can accent the gray without looking unnatural. "The silver highlights can help reflect light, making the hair look brighter," Byrd tells Best Life.&nbsp;Adding highlights will ultimately help contrast any yellow tones and will make it less noticeable in the long term. If you do <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>get highlights</a>, make sure to get them touched up on a regular basis to keep the yellow at bay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/shutterstock_2199090591.jpg><p>The sun is the number one cause behind yellowing hair. It doesn't matter what color your hair is, if you're outside with bright rays for a long period of time, lightening or yellowing is going to occur. However, it might be easier to spot on the grays. <strong>Lauren Holland</strong>, a professional hair stylist and leading hair care expert at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>LatestLocks.com</a> explains that the sun eliminates the blue and purple molecules in your hair which allows the yellow tones to seep out. "B<span>e mindful of how much time you spend outside and make sure to cover your head."&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/shutterstock_230518906.jpg><p>Different types of food and beverages affect your body in varied waysâ€”the same goes for your hair. "Limiting your intake of beta-carotene-rich foods can prevent yellowing," says Holland. Though they are beneficial for you in many ways, vegetables including carrots and spinach, as well as fruits such as tomato or cantaloupe are ones to look out for if you do notice more yellowish areas. Too much of the wrong food can likely throw your hair coloring way off balance.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>If You're Letting Your Hair Go Gray, Do This First, Experts Say</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/shutterstock_1109336267.jpg><p>Your hair is constantly changing in color and texture as you age and no one knows how to better take care of it than your stylist.

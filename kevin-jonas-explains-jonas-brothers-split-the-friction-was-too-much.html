Over a year after calling it quits, <a href=#><strong>Kevin Jonas</strong></a> is shedding new light on why the Jonas Brothers decided to throw in the towel.</p><p>"We were really lucky. Being a band that was able to tour, travel the world, and make music that we love, and then be received well I think was great," Jonas, 27, said during an interview with <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a> on Wednesday, Jan. 7. "At the end the friction was too much. We just really needed to break away and kind of do our own things for some time."</p><p>Kevin and brothers <a href=#><strong>Joe</strong></a>, 25, and <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a>, 22, announced in October 2013 that they were disbanding. One month earlier, they showed signs of trouble when they cancelled their 19-date tour just two days before the first show.</p><p>The New Jersey natives have moved on <a href=#>from the "rift"</a> they once had, and still remain close. As it turns out, its the breakup that helped them keep their relationships intact as they embark on solo projects.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I think that's why we're still close now," Jonas told HuffPost Live. "It's because we aren't in the band. I think that constant of butting heads and working together â€” we chose to be a family and not a band."</p><p>Jonas has also started a family of his own <a href=#>since the decision.</a> He and his wife <strong>Danielle</strong> welcomed daughter <strong>Alena</strong> in February 2014. He's recently had a cameo on The Real Housewives of New Jersey (<a href=#><strong>Kathy Wakile's</strong> contractor!</a>), and was eliminated from The&nbsp;Celebrity Apprentice this week. Nick, for his part, now has a solo career with hits like "Jealous" and "Numb" and has since turned heads with his <a href=#>hot, buff body.</a> Joe has kept a low profile, but reunited with ex Demi Lovato on stage back in September.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKerpmjequ7zZqqZp2opbmitc2sZKOnnpbAbq7RqKuhnaKoerS8y6KrZqyYmnqnvsicq6KnnmLEor%2BMraaoZZ2qsKl5kWlobnBh</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

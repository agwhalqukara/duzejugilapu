Rupert Evans, Adrienne Warren, Stephanie Jacob, and other brilliant actors are part of this compelling cast. The narrative revolves around what happens to Eleanor Bennett’s two children, Byron and Benny, after her death and how they come to receive an enigmatic legacy. A voice recording and a family recipe for a classic black cake from the Caribbean are what they inherited. The siblings are entangled in a web of family secrets and hidden history that stretches across the world, from the Caribbean to London and California, thanks to Eleanor’s recorded message. A lost kid, turbulent family history, long-buried secrets, and the dramatic story of a young swimmer who fled her native country on suspicion of murder are all revealed in this story. These are seven series that explore the intricate process of self-discovery, much like “Black Cake.”</p><h3>A Million Little Things (2018-2023)</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/A-Million-Little-Things-e1698880310161-2-1.jpg alt="black cake hulu release date,shows similar to black cake reddit,black cake hulu cast,black cake hulu trailer,black cake hulu 2023,black cake series,black cake hulu episodes,where to watch black cake,shows like black bird,shows similar to dark,shows similar to black cake in india,shows similar to black cake on netflix,shows similar to black cake series,shows similar to black cake tv series,shows similar to black cake,shows similar to big bang theory,shows similar to brooklyn nine nine" width=500 height=232 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The highly charged television series “A Million Little Things” centres on the lives of a close-knit group of friends in Boston.

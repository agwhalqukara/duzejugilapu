The Spencer family has been closely tied to the royal family for several generations. Since the Spencers were British nobility, Diana grew up in Park House — which was located on the royal family’s Sandringham estate — and often played with Prince Edward when she was a young girl. When she married Prince Charles in July 1981, Diana adopted the royal family’s last name, Mountbatten-Windsor.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Princess Diana and More Celebrities’ Last Words Before Death Revealed</a></p><h2>Who are Diana’s siblings?</h2><p>Diana has four siblings: Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, Charles Spencer, and the late John Spencer.

Her groom, Charles, was 32 the year of their wedding, making the couple’s significant age difference 12 years. Their age gap was reportedly one of the biggest strains on their union, which <a href=#>ultimately ended in divorce in August 1996</a>.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Prince Charles “Made a Huge Mistake” Marrying Princess Diana</a></p><h2>Who were Diana’s boyfriends?</h2><p>After Charles and Diana finalized their divorce, Prince William and Prince Harry’s mother began dating British-Pakistani heart surgeon Hasnat Khan. Though Diana and Hasnat’s relationship lasted nearly two years, the couple was immensely private about their romance and Diana repeatedly denied to the press that she was dating the doctor. The mother-of-two is thought to have ended their relationship in July 1997. Less than one month after her split from Hasnat, Diana began seeing Dodi Fayed. Diana, Dodi, and their driver, Henri Paul, were later all killed in a fatal, August 1997 car crash in Paris.</p><h2>What is a lady-in-waiting?</h2><p>A lady-in-waiting is a a woman who aids a queen or a princess in the royal family. Between 1981 and 1997, Diana had around eight ladies-in-waiting who acted as her personal assistants. The People’s Princess’ most famous lady-in-waiting was perhaps Anne Beckwith-Smith.</p><p><a href=#>MORE: Prince William on His Mother Princess Diana’s Death — “It Makes Me Sad She Never Met Kate, George, and Charlotte”</a></p><h2>Where is Diana buried?</h2><p>Following Diana’s public funeral at London’s Westminster Abbey on Sept. 6, 1997, the mother-of-two was <a href=#>buried on a private island within the grounds of Althorp Park</a>, the Spencer family’s home for centuries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e8WipZ1ln6rBbrTOsGSpqpmjsKa%2F0maaoZmioby1wMRmrqKknGK1prjPZpqaqqKuerC6jKmpoqaTmsC0ecOimKeZXah6rbHGmpqyZWVtgnGB</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

In those nineteen years together, Scottie had four kids with his wife Larsa; three sons named <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Scotty Pippen Jr</a>., Preston Pippen and, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Justin Pippen</a> and a daughter named Sophia Pippen.

And Preston <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">plays</a> basketball for his high school, Sierra Canyon HIghschool, which is not an odd thing at all.

We can guess that during the time of playing together, the father and son duo get plenty of time to bond with each other. And maybe who knows, Preston is training very hard to pursue a career in sports like his father and elder brother Scotty Pippen Jr.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Has_Musical_Talent></span>Has Musical Talent<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Preston is not only an athletic boy, following his father’s footsteps, but also has a fantastic piano skill.

However, he was taken away from the universe pretty soon, in April 2021. Their father, Scottie Pippen <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">announced the death</a> of his eldest child, Antron Pippen’s death via social media promising to meet him soon.</p><p>Papa Pippen also asked his fans and followers to keep his ex-wife and baby mama, Karen to keep in their prayers as she lost her child.

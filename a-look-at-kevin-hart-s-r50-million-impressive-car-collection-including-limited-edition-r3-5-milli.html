Kevin Hart allegedly owns two of the most sought-after vintage Mustang models</h2><p class=align-left>Unlike other celebrities who love the latest car models, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kevin Hart</a> is a collector of classic muscle cars. The actor always has his hands on limited edition models, making him the envy of many petrol heads.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong>Follow Briefly News on Twitter and never miss the hottest topics! Find us at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@brieflyza</a>!</p><p class=align-left>According to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hotcars.com</a></i>, Hart owns two of the most sought-after Mustang models, the 1965 Convertible and a 1967 Eleanor. The publication noted that only three examples of Hart's 1967 Eleanor are circulating today - talk about levels.</p><p class=align-left>Depending on the specification and modifications, the 1967 Eleanor reportedly ranges between R3.5 million to R3.7 million. The 1965 Convertible goes for a little over R1 million.</p><p class=align-left>Ford South Africa shares more details about why Hart's 1967 Eleanor and 1965 Convertible are special</p><p class=align-left>Speaking exclusively to Briefly News, Andrew Meropa from <a href=#>Ford</a> South Africa said the 1965 Convertible stood out from the cars from the same era because it was the perfect balance between efficiency and power. He said:</p>"The 1965 Mustang convertible was the First Generation of the Mustang. It was offered with various engine options to suit different preferences, budgets and performance needs. These engines ranged from inline-six cylinders to signature V8s, each offering a balance between fuel efficiency and power. The Mustang also stood out from other cars of that period thanks to a muscular design with a long bonnet as well as the many options which allowed owners to personalise their vehicle through a range of aesthetics and colour combinations."The Mustang’s appearance in movies/television shows also played a significant role in cementing its iconic status. Movies like "Bullitt" and "Gone in 60 Seconds" featured memorable Mustang chase scenes."Yet perhaps the trait that defined the Mustang’s popularity was its price. Cars of this ilk were usually expensive and exclusive but the Mustang made it possible for the average younger American to enjoy high-performance driving thrills. The Mustang is often credited with introducing the term ‘Pony Car’ thanks to a unique blend of style, V8 performance, and affordability."<p class=align-left>He also added that:</p>"The 1967 Mustang Eleanor is inspired by the Shelby GT 500 and features aggressive styling modifications that distinguished it from the standard 1967 Ford Mustang. It had a custom body kit by Chip Foose that included a unique front grille, side skirts, and a prominent rear spoiler, giving it a sleek and muscular appearance. Eleanor also had the performance to match its outward appearance, thanks to a modified 5.7-litre V8 that made over 400 horsepower in most states of tune."This Hollywood Hero gained its pop culture status due to its appearance with the remake of the popular film "Gone in 60 Seconds” and since then many aftermarket companies have replicated the Eleanor look."<h2>2.

She was 46.</p><p>The exact cause of her death remains unknown, but Brandon provided some insight on her tragic and sudden passing. “R.I.P my beautiful sister Charmayne ‘Maxee’ Maxwell,” he <a href=#>tweeted</a>. “I can’t even believe I’m typing this right now.”</p><p>“Bad things happened to the most innocent people,” he continued on Twitter. “My sister died in the most terrible way, and I’m in so much pain right now.”</p><p>The artist’s younger brother <a href=#>also took to Instagram</a> to mourn his sibling. “R.I.P to my beautiful sister Charmayne ‘Maxee’ Maxwell,” he wrote, alongside a stunning photo of the late songstress. “I’m so devasted because you deserved to stay on this earth much longer. You had such an amazing talent and you went really far with your singing career. I felt so inspired from you and it gave me motivation to become the best performer I could be. I love you so much sis, I’m so grateful I was able to have you in my life.”</p><p>Brandon then slammed a link that implied that Charmayne’s death was from an alleged suicide. “People are so dumb,” he tweeted. “This is actually BS.”</p><p>Charmayne rose to fame in the ’90s as part of the original trio of R&B girl group Brownstone, who were signed under Michael Jackson’s MJJ Music label. Brownstone’s first album, From the Bottom Up, went platinum and spent 37 weeks on the Billboard chart due, in part, to their lead 1994 single, “If You Love Me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>While Charmayne eventually split from the group to pursue her own path, her association to Brownstone was the pinnacle of her singing career. After the news was revealed this past weekend, her fellow Brownstone member <strong>Teisha Brown</strong> reacted to her shocking death.</p><p>“I just need to be by you 1 more time on stage MAX!” Trisha wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of the three performing together. “#Brownstone #Forever R.I.H. I miss you already!! My heart is so heavy. I LOVE YOU SISTER!!”</p><p>Charmayne is survived by her producer husband Carsten Soulshock and their son. The news of her death was first confirmed to Danish paper Ekstra Bladet by Charmayne’s mother-in-law, who is Danish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqhmaKirrq6xGakmrCnmrmtecOemJ1lkqe8uLqMrKCnn5WneqW1xKxkmqxdlrSmeZNvZGtoYWp%2BdA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

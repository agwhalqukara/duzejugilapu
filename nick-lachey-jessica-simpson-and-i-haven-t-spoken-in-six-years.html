On Tuesday, May 7, the 98 Degrees singer appeared with his bandmates on Bravo's <a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>, where he told host <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> that his relationship with his ex felt like a part of some distant era in history.</p><p>"It's been years [since the last time I talked to Jessica]. Years," he said, after Cohen asked about the Fashion Star mentor during a game of Plead the Fifth. "Honestly, probably six years…It was like another lifetime ago."</p><p>(Indeed, both Lachey and Simpson have new lives and new families now. The former, 39, married <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Minnillo</strong></a> in 2011 and welcomed son <strong>Camden</strong> in September 2012. Simpson, meanwhile, is engaged to <strong>Eric Johnson</strong>, with whom she has a 12-month-old daughter, <strong>Maxwell</strong>, and a son on the way.)</p><p>Asked whether he ever reminisces about his three-year marriage to the singer by watching episodes of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica, the MTV reality series that documented their relationship, Lachey laughed. "I have not," he replied.</p><p>"As you can imagine, that's not popular viewing in my house," he continued. "We don't sit around as a family and watch the old DVDs."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The boy bander also dished a little on being free of his ex's parents. "What is the best thing about no longer having <strong>Joe Simpson</strong> as a father-in-law?" Cohen asked.</p><p>"Can I answer this one?" Lachey's brother <strong>Drew</strong> piped in. "Everything!"</p><p>Simpson's ex-husband laughed, then added: "The best thing about not having Joe Simpson as a father-in-law [is]…I don't have to play grab-ass under the table on Easter Sunday."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKWim5tiuaKvx56wZqKVqMCqr8BmqqKloKi8r3nAp5tmoV2drrexza1krKifoLKvecinZKyhqGLGpq3RrGRraGFohXY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

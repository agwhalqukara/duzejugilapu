Nicole despairs, knowing Holly could be on that life support machine forever-she can’t lose her only child!</p><h2>Days Of Our Lives Spoilers: Minimum Brain Function</h2><p>Holly had overdosed on some pills that were likely laced with fentanyl, causing her to go into seizures nearly immediately. Nicole doesn’t even know where she got the pills, she had told Tate Black (Jamie Martin Mann) she got them from someone at school.</p><p>Two other teenagers had died from overdosing likely on the same substance, from what Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering) said. Tripp Johnson (Lucas Adams) said Holly was stable but had minimum brain function-hence her being put on life support; Nicole can’t believe this is happening, she’s in shock.</p><p>They just have to take it day by day, not knowing if Holly’s brain functions will ever heal or if she’ll ever be the same again. Nicole is beyond afraid that she’ll have to eventually make a decision to let her daughter go.</p><h3>DOOL Spoilers: Nicole DiMera Can’t Believe She Didn’t Know</h3><p>While EJ DiMera (Dan Feurreriegel) swears his stepdaughter doesn’t use drugs, Nicole can’t believe she didn’t know-even though she knows she experimented drinking.</p><p><img alt="Days Of Our Lives: Holly Jonas (Ashley Puzemis)" width=730 height=543 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/01/days-of-our-lives-spoilers-nicole-sits-vigil-with-holly-and-despairs-she-cant-lose-her-only-child/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Days Of Our Lives Spoilers: Nicole Sits Vigil With Holly And Despairs-She Can’t Lose Her Only Child!" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DOOL-Holly-Jonas.jpg></p><p>They’d came home on Christmas Day to find <a href=#>Holly having one heck of a hangover</a>-Nicole blames herself for leaving Holly alone on her birthday.</p><p>Even though Johnny DiMera (Carson Boatman) kept her company part of the time, he needed to go support Chanel Dupree (Raven Bowens) when Paulina Price (Jackée Harry) went to the hospital.</p><p>Nicole beats herself up inwardly for not being a better mother to Holly, being involved in her own life and loves; Holly probably felt like she didn’t exist in her eyes.</p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Spoilers: Nicole DiMera Prays, And Prays Hard</h3><p><a href=#>All Nicole can do is pray,</a> and pray hard for Holly to heal and recover, although the odds right now are pretty slim and EJ’s railroading Tate. EJ is lashing out because he can’t do anything but lash out, the situation seems so hopeless he feels helpless-just like Nicole herself does.</p><p>Nicole keeps beating herself up inside for focusing on anything and everything besides her daughter these past few years, she lost precious time with Holly.</p><p>She won’t be able to ever forgive herself if Holly doesn’t make it-and she will put her on a leash if she does. Nicole will never let her daughter out of her sight again if she’ll only wake up and be herself again.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with DOOL right now.

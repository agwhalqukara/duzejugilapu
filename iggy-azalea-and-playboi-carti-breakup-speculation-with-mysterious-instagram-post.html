Unfortunately, fans have been waiting for their new songs, but it doesn’t seem to be happening anytime soon. The couple had a baby boy recently, Onyx. A baby in the house is a good enough reason to keep them away from the music world for some time.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rumors were going on that Iggy Azalea and Carti have broken up, and these rumors were not baseless as Iggy Azalea has given credence to the rumors. On 23rd October, Iggy Azalea took to her Instagram story and posted some words about loyalty. Her Instagram story said that people take loyalty for granted, which is why she’d rather be alone! She added, “You lost a real 1!” The third story had three vomiting emojis.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Now, these words are not very difficult to interpret; after reading ‘you lost a real one,’ anyone would think that they have broken up. Still, the news was not confirmed, and the fans were guessing that the two will soon clarify the matter. It didn’t take fans long to confirm the information on Twitter and tweeted their concerns and questions!</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Liars are the worst thing ? <a href=#>@IGGYAZALEA</a> we don't want to get into your private life but if you need anything we are here to help you with anything ❤️☺️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HEfzhE7975</a></p>— The Honest Iggy Stan ???

NO MORE BISEXUAL VAMPIRE <a href=#>#IggyAzalea</a> <a href=#>#playboicarti</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YCYTFbcm21</a></p>— skit (@vloneskit) <a href=#>October 24, 2020</a><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A few hours after the initial posts, she returned to Instagram to remove any doubts and made it pretty clear that she is no more in a relationship! Iggy wrote that what she meant last night was that she is gonna raise her child alone, and she is not in a relationship anymore. Some of her fans were concerned for her, while some just said that what can you expect from someone who named himself “Playboi.” Some fans were in support of Carti and stated that he is finally free! However, we don’t know the cause of this break-up, and Carti has not commented on it publicly yet.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This is not something new as Iggy has made fans think that the couple broke up earlier also. Almost a year ago, she stated that she was single but later apologized for writing it on Instagram. Iggy wrote that it’s not her character to put everything that’s going on in her life on social media and then let the world comment on it. She added that she felt very upset later and regretted her impulse choice. To end the topic, she added that she loves Jordan very much, and that is all the world needs to hear.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Iggy gave birth to her and Carti’s child in July, and she tried to keep him away from the eyes of people as much as possible, but Iggy did point out that she wants to keep Onyx’s life private, but he is not a secret.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBtbvPqZyrq16YvK57yKCesmWRr66tscBmp6WZqZe8qnnCmqmtoV2Xv6atyq6naA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
